# Version Release Fix - October 2025

## Issue Summary
The release version was stuck on **1.0.1** and not incrementing with new commits to the main branch. This prevented:
- New releases from being created
- Updated packages from being deployed to NuGet.org
- Beta and alpha packages from having correct version numbers for PR builds

## Root Cause
The `GitVersion.yml` configuration file had the `next-version` field hardcoded to `1.0.1`:

```yaml
mode: Mainline
next-version: 1.0.1  # ← This was preventing GitVersion from auto-calculating versions
```

GitVersion is designed to automatically calculate versions based on:
- Git tags (e.g., `v1.0.1`)
- Branch configuration (e.g., `increment: Minor` on main branch)
- Commit history since the last tag

By hardcoding `next-version: 1.0.1`, we prevented GitVersion from incrementing past this base version, even though the repository had the tag `v1.0.1` at an older commit and new commits on main.

## Solution Applied
**Removed the `next-version` field entirely** from `GitVersion.yml`:

```yaml
mode: Mainline
# next-version removed - GitVersion will auto-calculate from tags
branches:
  main:
    increment: Minor  # Auto-increments minor version
```

Now GitVersion will:
1. Find the latest tag (`v1.0.1`)
2. Count commits since that tag
3. Apply the increment strategy (`Minor`) to calculate the next version
4. Automatically produce `1.1.0` (or higher) for new commits on main

## Impact of Fix
After this PR is merged to main:
- ✅ GitVersion will **automatically** calculate the next version as **1.1.0** (since `increment: Minor`)
- ✅ Clean packages will be published to NuGet.org with the auto-calculated version
- ✅ Packages will be published to GitHub Packages
- ✅ **No manual version updates needed** - GitVersion handles it automatically
- ✅ Future commits to main will continue to auto-increment

## How Versioning Works Now (Automatic)
GitVersion automatically manages versioning:

### For Minor Releases (Automatic)
Just merge to main - GitVersion will increment: `1.0.1 → 1.1.0 → 1.2.0 → ...`

### For Major Releases
Create a tag manually when needed:
```bash
git tag v2.0.0
git push --tags
```

### For Patch Releases
Change the increment strategy temporarily in `GitVersion.yml`:
```yaml
branches:
  main:
    increment: Patch  # Changes to patch increment
```

Then merge to main for `1.1.0 → 1.1.1 → 1.1.2 → ...`

## Why Automatic Versioning Is Better
- ✅ **No manual updates** - versions increment automatically with each merge
- ✅ **No version conflicts** - GitVersion calculates based on actual git history
- ✅ **Semantic versioning** - respects the increment strategy (Major/Minor/Patch)
- ✅ **Consistent** - works the same way across all branches

## Verification
You can verify the version that will be generated by running:

```bash
# Install GitVersion tool
dotnet tool install --global GitVersion.Tool --version 5.*

# Check the version that will be generated
dotnet-gitversion /showvariable SemVer
```

## Related Files
- `GitVersion.yml` - Removed `next-version` field to enable auto-versioning
- `PACKAGE-BUILDING.md` - Documentation updated to explain automatic versioning
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` - CD pipeline that creates releases
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI pipeline that publishes to GitHub Packages

## CI/CD Pipeline Status
Both pipelines are working correctly:
- **CI Pipeline**: Successfully builds and publishes pre-release packages to GitHub Packages
- **CD Pipeline**: Successfully creates releases and publishes to NuGet.org

GitVersion will now automatically calculate versions based on tags and commits.
